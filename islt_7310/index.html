    <p>Hi! I am Tracie Devault, an Assistant Teaching Professor at Missouri S&T in Communication. I have been in Higher Education since 2009 which I began teaching Public Speaking as an adjunct for a local Community College.  Communication and public speaking are my passion, stemming from my years in Masonic Youth Organizations and culminating in my chosen career.   I believe that communication is truly the key to improving ourselves and our overall society.  When our communication skills are lacking, we are unable to move forward – not as individuals or collectively.  </p>
