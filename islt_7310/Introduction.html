     Hi! I am Tracie Devault, an Assistant Teaching Professor at Missouri S&T in Communication.  I am on my last course of the Master’s Certificate in Online Learning (woo hoo!).  I have no coding or programming experience so this should be quite the adventure.  My expectation in the course is to be able to understand a tiny part of coding a website.  This is all far above my head so I want to just gain a basic understanding.  I honestly don’t know that I will ever really use the skills but I never thought I’d be remotely teaching Public Speaking with a two day  notice either.  My hobbies revolve around my family and dogs.  My wife and I love to cook together and discover foodie treasures.  We have a brand new grand baby and four idiot dogs.  Our life is chaotic!  I look forward to “meeting” all of you!
